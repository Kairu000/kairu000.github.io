[Stratos](https://gist.github.com/Kairu000/7f9d216fd5112f05c11dc656a734452d)
, is a game that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
 The story is about the player fighting monsters as a camptain of an airship. 

### While Loop
[While Loop](https://gist.github.com/Kairu000/821d9c58cc4321216f0e354ffcf1493b) is a demonstration of how code can be repeatable within set parameters. 

### Choose Your Adventure
[Choose Your Adventure](https://gist.github.com/Kairu000/8c38e75b38ea6bb2bb77fc3c7130fe5b) shows a way to change the game experience by having different set dialog triggered due to player input. 

### List RPG
[List RPG](https://gist.github.com/Kairu000/695f6a45344fe4c166633dc8c777ec8d) shows an example of how a game experience can be coded so that it can change along the player's choices. Like finding a key and adding it to their inventory. List RPG gave me a quick way of giving the character in my game the ability to "unlock" parts of the game, like abilities, as if they just found a key. 

### Adopt an Insect
[Adpot an Insect](https://gist.github.com/Kairu000/84ef9121ea47619e4aff8bb9e4eb46c3) is an app that lets the player take care and customize a pet.
